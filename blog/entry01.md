# Deciding on My Topic
What I had decided on was mechanical engineering for its creativity and critical thinking to solve current issues at hand or to help on a much larger problem at play as in mechanics and how it helps build the machines we use today. Why I wanted to choose this was becuase of my lack of creativity although I know how to think in a situation, critical thinking is endorsed by logic rather than ingenuity sparked from the imagination. What I did to figure out and learn about this career was through tests and my computer science class of "SEP". A article that helped reach this conclusion was through Michigan Tech- [What Is an Engineer?](https://www.mtu.edu/engineering/about/engineers/) This introductory article is examples to what led me to work on this today and better understand the role a engineer has. Another example would be from Geneva college-[What Do Mechanical Engineers Do?](https://www.snhu.edu/about-us/newsroom/stem/what-do-mechanical-engineers-do) As it explained and reinforced the idea that engineers and especially mechanical engineers do their best to build and expand on topic that is traumatic; for mechanical engineers it would be with machines and how machines can help benefit us with our daily lives. Seeing how all of this is implemented was extraordinary and eye opening to help with my passion it helped be more determined toward being a mechanical engineer.

### Engineering Design Process
As the beginning to my learning process in becoming a engineer and defining worldy problems such as **Pollution**. My current take on the problem is to begin research through websites/articles or by word of mouth to learn and devise a steady plan to slow or stop what is now a threat "**Pollution**." Steps towards this goal would be to first determine how to solve this problem through research on the topic of **pollution**. Second being to devise plans on how to solve this issue like have dams or the sewers throughout a city to have a filtering device before the water is released back into the enviroment to keep water with microplastics or other waste to reach the oceans that make up the world. 

### Skills
What I believe can help me as a first step would be my ability in the **use of google and socializing**" As they make up the basics of learning and a 2nd or even a 3rd opinion.

### Googling
The ability to access and use google is a feat by itself as it allows us nar endless posiblities to research and build upon what we can know. What I can do is use keywords to filter and simplify my search. What is deemed as useful can be articles with similar keywords or phrases like "**How do engineers help people**," what I found was this article [https://www.sacredheart.edu/news-room/news-listing/5-ways-engineers-are-helping-to-shape-our-future/](https://www.sacredheart.edu/news-room/news-listing/5-ways-engineers-are-helping-to-shape-our-future/) by Sacred Heart University to be a start.

### socializing
A important skill for any form of work requires people to group up, either for efficiency or for similar ideals. The ability to socialize allows even for engineers to solve problem they themself have no idea about. As such for the project I will confide in my colleagues to help me if they do have similar opinions or questions as to help relieve or improve upon ourselves.
## Summary 
Until next time I will attempt to improve on my amount of sources, research on Engineering efforts on pollution, and how engineers should be.
