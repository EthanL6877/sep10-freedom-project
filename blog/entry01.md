# Deciding on My Topic
What I had decided on was mechanical engineering for its creativity and critical thinking to solve current issues at hand or to help on a much larger problem at play as in mechanics and how it helps build the machines we use today. Why I wanted to choose this was becuase of my lack of creativity although I know how to think in a situation, critical thinking is endorsed by logic rather than ingenuity sparked from the imagination. What I did to figure out and learn about this career was through tests and my computer science class of "SEP". A article that helped reach this conclusion was through Michigan Tech- [What Is an Engineer?](https://www.mtu.edu/engineering/about/engineers/) This introductory article is examples to what led me to work on this today. Another example would be from [What Do Mechanical Engineers Do?](https://www.snhu.edu/about-us/newsroom/stem/what-do-mechanical-engineers-do) 

### Engineering Design Process
As the beginning to my learning process in becoming a engineer and defining worldy problems such as **Pollution**. My current take on the problem is to begin research through websites/articles or by word of mouth to learn and devise a steady plan to slow or stop what is now a threat "**Pollution**."

### Skills
What I believe can help me as a first step would be my ability to **use of google and socializing**" 

### Googling
The ability to access and use google is a feat by itself as it allows us nar endless posiblities to research and build upon what we can know. What I can do is use keywords to filter and simplify my search. What is deemed as useful can be articles with similar keywords or phrases like "**How do engineers help people**," what I found was this article [https://www.sacredheart.edu/news-room/news-listing/5-ways-engineers-are-helping-to-shape-our-future/](https://www.sacredheart.edu/news-room/news-listing/5-ways-engineers-are-helping-to-shape-our-future/) by Sacred Heart University to be a start.

### socializing
A important skill for any form of work requires people to group up, either for efficiency or for similar ideals. The ability to socialize allows even for engineers to solve problem they themself have no idea about. As such for the project I will confide in my colleagues to help me if they do have similar opinions or questions as to help relieve or improve upon ourselves.
## Summary 
Until next time I will attempt to improve on my amount of sources, research on Engineering efforts on pollution, and how engineers should be.
