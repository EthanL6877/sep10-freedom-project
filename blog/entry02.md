### Googling
The ability to access and use google is a feat by itself as it allows us nar endless posiblities to research and build upon what we can know. What I can do is use keywords to filter and simplify my search. What is deemed as useful can be articles with similar keywords or phrases like "**How do engineers help people**," what I found was this article [https://www.sacredheart.edu/news-room/news-listing/5-ways-engineers-are-helping-to-shape-our-future/](https://www.sacredheart.edu/news-room/news-listing/5-ways-engineers-are-helping-to-shape-our-future/) by Sacred Heart University to be a start.

### socializing
A important skill for any form of work requires people to group up, either for efficiency or for similar ideals. The ability to socialize allows even for engineers to solve problem they themself have no idea about. As such for the project I will confide in my colleagues to help me if they do have similar opinions or questions as to help relieve or improve upon ourselves.
