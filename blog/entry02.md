## Entry 2:Break down
### Content(research)
During my time researching I have found that there is a multitude of websites that I have searched on for mechanical engineering.
What I found to be hard mainly about my subject is the level of math and formulas needed for the **physics.** What helped me in my research was first what the role of a physicist in society through this [site](https://www.mtu.edu/physics/what/) by Michigan Technological University by explaining what a physicist does and how they achieve success in their field. Although I am talking about Mechanical Engineering, without understanding what makes up Mechanical engineering I wouldn't understand it. Since Mechanical Engineering is such a vague subject. While it includes a wide variety of subjects it allows for much freedom in research which then allows me to more easily build upon meaning I can reach out to many sources. A source would be like this video I watched to then explore deeper on physics through this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1t41Q3xRM8)
### Engineering Design Process
While I may have stated before about my innovation on pollution it was a example of current day software to be more for automated efficiency rather than precision as machines lack both speed and enough energy when in the use of the more advanced machinary. While pollution is a problem, such large scale problems like this take more than precision to nitpick all the microplastics.
In order to do this we would require more light weight and a mass quantity of such machinery to get through so much waste since garbage patches like the **"Great Pacific Garbage Patch"** as it continues to grow in size it steadily becomes unsolvable.
### Skills
My skills have improved during class and outside hours to furthur my approach on **mechanical Engineering** and as such are shown.

### Googling
During class hours I found myself trying to learn more and more about what being a mechanical engineer includes to be a benficial member of society as a career such as Mechanical engineering requires much research. A website that I always found myself going back to was [**Reddit.**](https://www.reddit.com/)  The site being a libary of sources and helpful information to rely on as it is a community built on helping each other answer questions.

### socializing
While socializing is found anywhere what I did most of it was online as it was where I could talk to easily about a reoccuring issue or problem I may be running across from time to time. Such instances would be in coding and although it is a site generally for helping students [**Slack**](https://slack.com/) it is a way to connect to others without the distractions that come along with things like **Discord** or **Snapchat** as these apps are more generalized for social media.
