### Content(research)
During my time researching I have found that there is a multitude of websites that I have searched on for mechanical engineering.
What I found to be hard mainly about my subject is the level of math and formulas needed for the **physics.** What helped me in my research was first what the role of a physicist in society through this [site](https://www.mtu.edu/physics/what/) by Michigan Technological University by explaining what a physicist does and how they achieve success in their field. Although I am talking about Mechanical Engineering, without understanding what makes up Mechanical engineering I wouldn't understand it. Since Mechanical Engineering is such a vague subject. While it includes a wide variety of subjects it allows for much freedom in research which then allows me to more easily build upon meaning I can reach out to many sources. A source would be like this video I watched to then explore deeper on physics through this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1t41Q3xRM8)
### Engineering Design Process
While I may have stated before about my innovation on pollution it was a example, what I do hope to achieve is for devices/software to be more precise as machines are automated for efficiency they lack both speed and energy when in the use of the more advanced machinary
