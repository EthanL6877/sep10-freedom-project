Topic: **Mechanical Engineering**

## Overview/Introduction/Context
* Mechanical enginnering is the leading focus in modern technology as they involve themselves with the research, design, construction and testing of mechanical devices and sensors, including various tools, engines and machines their proficiency in the use of both technology and math to determine a solution for a problem relies not on knowledge but the creativity and will to ultimately overcome a issue either long lasting or recent.  
* Activities that involve the use of mechanical engineering is the testing and manufacturing of equipment/products to then improve upon for a higher probability that it will work to then use it to handle problems for example peopel with missing limbs to be given a chance to have a mechanical arm or prosthesis in replacement of that missing limb.

## Part A: existing technology
* 1st google search was "Websites for mechanical engineering"
* The first website I checked was  [https://interestingengineering.com/culture/12-educational-websites-that-every-mechanical-engineer-should-know](https://interestingengineering.com/culture/12-educational-websites-that-every-mechanical-engineer-should-know)
  * 1st app I looked into was [EDX](https://www.edx.org/)
  * The site shows a multitude of programs and courses that support the role of Mechanical enginner including computer science, leadership/communication, and analytics
  * Explains as to how to apply for each course/program and what can come along with the acceptance of the course/program
  * The layout of the app is easy to traverse as you scroll down the site it explains and shows what their best at while explaining their purpose
  * Allows the user to create a free account
  * Many free programs/courses for anyone while also having english, chinese, spanish, and even italian speakers
  * Can be accesed on I.O.S 15 or later and for Chrome ver.100 or after

* 2nd website I checked was [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/)
  * This site first shows insight on how to build or about the right tools or decor for what you need
  * Shows multiple designs for festive based objects depending on the closest holiday
  * A informational site for learning on how to build and for creative desgining
  * Can be used only on basic search engines including but not all of: Google, Safari, and Bing

* Software/devices
* A devicce I researched was the Cyberknife
* 1st link I researched:  [https://cyberknife.com/cyberknife-how-it-works/](https://cyberknife.com/cyberknife-how-it-works/)
  * Doesn't damage anhy tissue besides the where the targeted radiation goes to
  * With motion synchronization the Cyberknife can easily track an accomodate for the human bodies movement to more easily track down a tumor or cancer.
* 2nd link:[https://radonc.ucsf.edu/cyberknife/](https://radonc.ucsf.edu/cyberknife/)
  * They explain the uses of the Cyberknife that being it can target specific areas on the body with radiation even harder to reach places like the spine.
  * Has low risk of failiure
  * Short amount of time for a procedure to be completed
  * Doesn't require much preparation
* 3rd link was:[https://ahs.atlantichealth.org/conditions-treatments/cancer-care/cancer-treatment-options/cyberknife-radiosurgery.html](https://ahs.atlantichealth.org/conditions-treatments/cancer-care/cancer-treatment-options/cyberknife-radiosurgery.html)
  * The Cyberknife can be used under most insurances and financial help
  * can be preformed on a outpatient basis meaning the patient isn't forced overnight to remain at a hospital for cyberknife procedures
  * real time built in x-rays to easily check the body
  * can reach a multitude of tumors and not just including these brain, spine, liver, pancreas
## Part B: possible future technology 
* Mechancical Engineering will be further be developed by both A.I and human creativity
  * Since Mechanical engineering was the basis for most if not all moving technology we still lack the ability to produce designs that should work the best. That's where A.I comes in as it can help correct some if not all mistakes and to not rely on such experimental A.I that's where we humans come although.Although  A.I and humans share the same process of learning Humans have the ability to learn and think beyond simple commands, such as the term known as creativity. Creativity then leads us to creating a solid solution and having opposing opinions allow us to question and then build upon mistakes so having the best of both worlds the knowledge with the creativity of humans help to determine and define a problem for solving.
