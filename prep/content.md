Topic: **Mechanical Engineering**

## Overview/Introduction/Context
* Mechanical enginnering is the leading focus in modern technology as they involve themselves with the research, design, construction and testing of mechanical devices and sensors, including various tools, engines and machines their proficiency in the use of both technology and math to determine a solution for a problem relies not on knowledge but the creativity and will to ultimately overcome a issue either long lasting or recent.  
* Activities that involve the use of mechanical engineering is the testing and manufacturing of equipment/products to then improve upon for a higher probability that it will work to then use it to handle problems for example peopel with missing limbs to be given a chance to have a mechanical arm or prosthesis in replacement of that missing limb.

## Part A: existing technology
* 1st google search was "Websites for mechanical engineering"
* The first website I checked was  [https://interestingengineering.com/culture/12-educational-websites-that-every-mechanical-engineer-should-know](https://interestingengineering.com/culture/12-educational-websites-that-every-mechanical-engineer-should-know)
  * 1st site I looked into was [https://www.edx.org/](https://www.edx.org/)

## Part B: possible future technology
* Idea
  * Detail
